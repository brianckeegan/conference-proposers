In this session, we aim to discuss what we can do to recruit students and develop their skills to become leaders, starting in their campus. We will brainstorm on campaigns, strategies, programs and activities that we can hold to not only create Firefox Student Ambassadors, but also young contributors who will eventually become Mozilla's community builders in the future.","agenda":"The facilitators will first discuss what Mozilla currently has for student involvement (Firefox Student Ambassadors) and we will describe the positive impacts it brought to community engagement. However, the FSA program focuses more on promotion of Mozilla, as it lacks the aspect of developing the Ambassadors by turning them into long term contributors who can aid in building more communities. We will ask participants on how they think students will get interested to be involved with Mozilla and what they think will make them become core contributors in the future.","scale":"For small groups, we can have a general session where we are all on the same pace. When we get a huge number, we will breakout into groups to address specific areas about the topic.","outcomes":"The preferred outcome is an enhanced program/campaign for student involvement that may be put in line with the FSA program. It can also be a separate program from FSA.

Ascend Portland will have *just* finished so I really want to get people thinking about how they could take what this project managed to do and create their own versions - either as short or long form projects.  We can work on ways to promote greater diversity from concept to completion.","scale":"With a few participants, especially if they are already event organizers, we could seriously commit time to creating their next event, incorporating aspects of Ascend's approach.  With larger numbers I think it could be interesting to break out into smaller groups where each groups focuses on one area of the development process, then people cycle through those to get a chance to design each one themselves with their personal project's lens.","outcomes":"Going forward, more events created by us will have language geared to wider diversity, considerations that would be more welcoming to more people, that adult learning will have perceived value increased, and that there will be more projects like Ascend in more countries.","timestamp":"2014-09-11T12:16:43.980Z"},{"title":"Taming the Beast: Techniques for Crowdsourced Discovery in Open Data Investigations","theme":"Source Code for Journalism","themeSlug":"journalism","facilitators":[{"name":"Jonathon Morgan","twitter":"@jonathonmorgan"}],"organization":"Ushahidi","goals":"We'll collaborate on techniques, tools and best practices for open data investigation, analysis and visualization.","agenda":"After a short overview of the available tools, small groups will work through sample investigations and build a visual narrative from open data.","scale":"We'll be prepared with enough sample problems for 2 to 10 small groups of collaborators, so regardless of how many people attend the session, everyone who attends will have the same opportunity to meet and participate in the group work.","outcomes":"We're committed to building a community of makers, storytellers and scientists who can collaborate on projects that drive change by making sense of massive data.

There are so many great looking websites out there, but very few of them load quickly on a mobile device or on a slower broadband connection. This is especially significant in emerging countries with slower connection speeds. We want the web to be accessible to everyone!\n\nDuring this session, I would like to take developers right back to basics and show them step-by-step how to improve the page load performance of their applications. This session would be a simple guide to web performance using a number of open source tools that are available today.","agenda":"Using example websites and open source performance tools, this session will be a step by step guide on improving web performance. I would like to run through a before and after snapshot of a few example websites, highlighting the massive difference that a few simple changes can make to the performance of a web page. This session would work well as more of a show and tell, but could also be adjusted to fit into a hands-on session.","scale":"Regardless of the size of the participants in this session, the show and tell aspect would allow many developers to learn and grasp a few key takeaways that they can use in their daily development of software. \n\nIf you prefer the session to have less participants, it can easily be adjusted to a more hands-on session where I walk through and work closely with the participants.","outcomes":"During this session, I would use an example website that would be available on Github. This source code could then be used and distributed in order to help new developers learn these techniques. It would be great if the participants could contribute and constantly grow the source code on Github with new web performance techniques and concepts.","timestamp":"2014-09-11T12:16:43.981Z"},{"title":"A to Z of Blogging (From starting up a blog and making the most out of it)","theme":"Build and Teach the Web","themeSlug":"teach","facilitators":[{"name":"Varun Kaushik","twitter":"@varunkaushik07"},{"name":"Pradeep Kumar","twitter":""}],"organization":"","goals":"The session focuses on how to start up a great blog with a perfect niche and make the most out of it.\nPeople will learn what does it take to build a successful blog by using the perfect tools and making the most out of it (earn money online with your blog).

I think it can be an excellent showcase of another potential of Firefox OS devices. Here's the pitch that I wrote for JSConf:\n\nFirefox OS is marketed as an OS for mobile phones. Cool. But what if we do one step back and omit the UI layer. Then a Firefox OS phone is a handset that's cheaper (25$) than a bare-bone Raspberry Pi, that includes a ton of sensors, GPS, network connectivity, a battery and a screen. And on top of that it's running the Gecko render engine that has APIs to access all that goodness. It's time to take some phones apart, start hacking and roll our own OS on top of Gecko. Internet of things FTW!\n\nWhat about a Firefox OS based doorbell system over bluetooth? A jacket tracker with GPS in case you go out and your jacket gets jacked? A small device that tracks how much you drink during a party? Home surveillance using a network of phones and a bluetooth speaker for an alarm? In this session we'll see some crazy hacks, and you'll should be all set to start hacking yourself!","agenda":"Depends a bit on the audience. If we have mainly developers in the audience I would like to dive into the code. Stripping off the UI layer of FxOS and replacing it with small customized OS'es that we write ourselves. Otherwise I'd make it into a demo party, showing how you can abuse the Internet of Things to make your life better, all while running on top of Gecko; and flavour it a bit with JavaScript.","scale":"Anything 20+ wouldn't require me doing any different, just presentation style.

[1] The main goal would be to build and detail a commitment curve for not just contributors, but also for mentors and the community based on a framework. Essentially, the goal is to bring together  separate strategies, in a way that reinforces and leverages the presence of local communities. The curve pathways is expected to act as a guide for the community as a measure of progress and provide a rough idea of support that should be received or extended.\n\n[1] https://blog.mozilla.org/community/2014/07/24/why-do-people-join-and-stay-part-of-a-community-and-how-to-support-them/","agenda":"As mentioned, the main goal would be to build a commitment curve for contributors, mentors and the local community based on a framework.

First, the introduction, wherein we will start with an overview and the context and background of the idea of commitment curve and how it may help. Followed by that we split into small groups (of approx. 5 each) which will discuss strategies for engaging and scaling the community based on a framework. This will be an important part of the session. An attempt would be made to ensure that the groups have a diverse background - that is have a good mix of community members and leaders. Finally, we will regroup and the groups present their take on the pathways.","scale":"The essence of the session wouldn’t change with the numbers. Only the number of people per group will change.

The expectation is that the participants take the idea of the commitment curves and the notion of leveraging the local communities by way of these pathways and implement the same in their own communities and teams while progressively improving on it.

Partner up with someone working on a topic unfamiliar to you and help them fine tune the presentation (You'll learn a new data skill along the way!).\nDon't know how to create lessons about data? Come join a group and learn with them as they develop something new.","scale":"At the low end of participation, we still hope to complete at least a handful of lessons that will then be available to the wider community. With additional participation, not only do we hope to complete more lessons, but we will also have the opportunity to expose people to new topics. More importantly, we will have a chance to engage in community-driven peer review and discussion, and to coach people who may never have worked collaboratively on lesson materials before.","outcomes":"We anticipate at least three significant outcomes from the event:\n\nIf our primary objective is successful, we should have several CC licensed data lessons ready for anyone to learn from or teach with. That alone would be a huge win. But more importantly, we will lay the ground work for ongoing collaboration among various groups that support data literacy among researchers. We expect lesson building activities and improvements to continue on well beyond Mozfest. Finally, the workshop would also be an ideal opportunity for novices to learn about curriculum development and pedagogy in small groups.","timestamp":"2014-09-11T12:16:43.997Z"},{"title":"Securing Mozilla","theme":"Securing Mozilla","facilitators":[{"name":"Sumanth Damarla","twitter":"@Sumanth_Damarla"},{"name":"Sudarshan Reddy Kurri","twitter":"@kurrisudarshan"}],"organization":"","goals":"This session focuses on creating Web Security Awareness for the participants. Its helps the participants to build their applications more securely using Web Security Tools.With the help of web security tools, People can attack their own designed Web applications and check for the vulnerabilities in their applications and code it more securely. \n\nFor an instance, Assume a coder coded an Login page, He can use ZAP (Web Security Tool) to attack his Login page in different ways and sort out the ways to trace out the flaws. In this way ZAP gives the coder chance to build their Web Application more securely. (Though its only one of the many features of ZAP)","agenda":"With the right skills, tools and software, you can protect yourself and remain secure.There is a need detect online scams and 'phishing' by employing recognized tools and techniques.  \nWe gonna introduce participants Top Security Tool of 2013 as votes by ToolsWatch.org “ZAP”(Zed Attack Proxy).\nAfter giving a presentation on working of ZAP, participants will have a Hands-on session to come to know the features of ZAP. They can attack the sample authorized websites to know how these Security Tool work.","scale":"With 5 participants I would be guiding them to work individually. So that they can get to know about ZAP on their own. Also handling 5 participants individually will be easy.\n\nWith 15 participants I would ask them to work in small groups. This would help us to interact for good amount of time. Also it would be convenient to help groups rather than individuals for 15 participants.\n\nWith 50 participants I would ask them to work as per our guidance.Will make one group leader per domain who can interact with us and help their group efficiently.","outcomes":"We would be able to show path for the participants how he/she can contribute to Mozilla in Web Security Aspects.","timestamp":"2014-09-11T12:16:43.997Z"},{"title":"Privacy & Mozilla","theme":"Policy & Advocacy","themeSlug":"policy","facilitators":[{"name":"Anup Kumar Mishra","twitter":"@anupmishra29"},{"name":"Ankit Mishra","twitter":""},{"name":"Ajay Kumar","twitter":""},{"name":"Bhuvnesh Dogra","twitter":""}],"organization":"Mozilla Rep","goals":"They will learn more about Privacy and how Mozilla helps in maintaining Privacy.

This works by connecting multiple wireless access points together, and then routing traffic across them. During periods of civil unrest like the Arab Spring, civilians organized and spoke openly on social media, and subsequently the involved governments sought to limit access to the internet. In a typical model with an ISP, this is as easy as cutting a cord. Mesh networking doesn't allow for this because it's never reliant on a single point of access, it heals itself if a point in the mesh goes down, access to local resources on the mesh always remains open, it’s open source and freely available, and accessible by anyone with WiFi. This session would introduce people to the concept, and also teach them how to create one themselves.","agenda":"Inside the session, access to the internet outside would be forbidden. Only mobile phones, mesh access points, and laptops. The only information available on the mesh would be the information contained on people’s devices. We'll start off with just 2 hand-held wireless routers as mesh points, and add more as the group expands. Eventually the mesh could grow as large as the entire conference area, with people sharing information in a secure and decentralized fashion unlike any form of networking they might be used to. We'll use the mesh network in this simulated internet blackout to get people thinking about the need to create decentralized and citizen-built networks.","scale":"This session could be lead with an attendance of up to 150 people (or as few as 10), but the only real limitation is session leaders and session members willing to lend a hand, because the mesh is massively expandable. It could extend across the entire event space, connecting everyone, if enough people participate!","outcomes":"We hope to use the session as a way to offer education about creating a more open web, circumventing censorship, and the importance of net neutrality. We hope that by the end of the session, participants have a new understanding of the internet, decentralized networks, the essentialness of net neutrality, and how to maintain our ability to share information even in the event of an internet blackout. We hope to see session participants take the idea home and build on top of it like we're working on doing in Chattanooga, by establishing internet connected mesh networks in areas of low income and connectivity in an effort to bridge the digital divide in a cost effective manner.","timestamp":"2014-09-11T12:16:43.998Z"},{"title":"Get involved with Mozilla Cloud Services","theme":"Build and Teach the Web","themeSlug":"teach","facilitators":[{"name":"Edwin Wong","twitter":"@e_w"}],"organization":"Mozilla Corporation","goals":"Introduces current projects as well as community based projects connecting people to each other and technology.","agenda":"Brainstorm on what Cloud Services you want\nCommunity based projects - let's do it!\nIntro to Cloud Services projects shipping soon and how to get involved","scale":"Based upon the number we would break up into groups of 3-4 for brainstorm and community based projects.

Open source hardware is moving in the same path for physical devices. I would like to show people how these two worlds can be bridged to enable reproducible science in the lab … and everywhere else.\n\nThe session will be around “Lantz”: an open source and BSD-licensed Python toolkit for instrumentation and control of laboratory equipment. I started this project to scratch my own itch, but it has grown as a very useful tool in the lab replacing expensive proprietary solutions.\n\nIn this session people will learn about lab automation and how it can help citizen science. During the session, people will make an app to control an experiment using Lantz.\n\nCheck out the project: http://lantz.readthedocs.org/","agenda":"After an introduction to lab automation including its importance to achieve reproducible science and robust results, I will give an description of Lantz. I will emphasize the key concepts and philosophy giving a few examples on my way. Importantly, I will show how many of this ideas can be used to control open source hardware and other devices that are becoming more and more available outside the lab.\n\nThe rest of the session will be hands on. Ideally people will bring their own laptops (only Python 3.2+ is needed) and we will develop something together. To deal with the lack of instruments to test, Lantz provides a few simulators that behave as standard lab equipment. We will do everything from the driver to the front-end, showing how you can make a full-fledged acquisition app in a very short time leveraging what is already in Lantz.","scale":"The initial part of the session (talk) is independent of the size. For the hands-on session it depends not only on the size but on the experience of the participants. Ideally I would like to divide in groups in such a way that I can walk from one to another helping people out.","outcomes":"First, I hope that this session raise awareness about the importance of automation and how compartmentalized the situation currently is. There is little sharing of acquisition programs among scientific groups. This is partly due the culture of the community but also due to the diversity of the equipment and platforms. \n\nI hope that Lantz can help, but to achieve this goal it has to grow first. I hope that the festival boosts the number of users and contributors. \n\nIn relation to this, I would like that the scientist/engineers among the participants start using Lantz in their labs. I would also like to see the project being used more and more outside the lab, in schools and hobby projects.","timestamp":"2014-09-11T12:16:43.998Z"},{"title":"Locks & Physical Security","theme":"Seeing how to make things do what you weren't expecting","facilitators":[{"name":"Babak Javadi","twitter":"@babakjavadi @TCGsec"}],"organization":"The CORE Group","goals":"This session will cover the basics of lockpicking and explain how the hardware upon which we rely for physical security can be subverted, attacked, and often completely compromised unless care is taken during its selection and installation.  Lockpicking has become a hot topic and fun hobby in the tech community of late... if you've never learned, now's your chance!","agenda":"Through detailed diagrams, mechanical animations, and direct example we will cover the topic of lockpicking and also showcase other simple attacks that physical penetration testers or even criminals might use to attempt to get past security.  Then, the audience will learn how, just as easily, these attacks can be greatly frustrated and in many cases prevented entirely.","scale":"The visuals are crisp and simple and can be seen just as easily if you are in the front row or all the way in the back of the room.  Adequate hands-on demo gear and locks will be with us for any size group, large or small.","outcomes":"I'm willing to bet that many of those who try lockpicking for the first time will want to keep at it long after they've gone home!

Our new crowdscraping platform allows developers to spend a few hours to release open data that can be of monumental importance to NGOs and journalists. On the other hand, people who cannot code can still play an important part by finding datasets. NGOs, Investigators and Journalists rely on freely accessing this information to campaign for a better and open world.

The goal is to increase visual literacy and metaphorical thinking skills while learning complex vocabulary and practicing purposeful doodling. Using a phrase randomizer site tailored to one's ability (good for all ages!) users try to articulate the meaning with visuals (analog or digital). The daily challenge encourages collegial drawing though users may choose their own phrases. Extension ideas would be randomized song lyrics people would need to illustrate and/ or randomized Netflix micro-genres that would inspire someone to draw a movie poster with title and image.","agenda":"Since I am proposing this for the Open Studio Space in \"Art and Culture of the Web\", where artists are working together and encouraging others to join in, I might have them draw phrase combinations out of a hat or use the randomizer site..perhaps giving artists a time limit to draw and \"judging\" the most effectively articulated. It's really interesting to see different interpretations of the same words, so that could generate some discussion (of creative process/ reasoning). I'd want it to be fun and low-pressure, showing everyone can doodle! It'd be great to show the artists draw in real time connected to a screen, and display all works.","scale":"Passers-by could be drawn in (no pun intended) by choosing the phrases or words to combine into an adjective+noun phrase out of a hat (or use the randomizer site). In the Open Studio Space, I can envision no more than several doodlers working at a given time, but the process is so fast we could rotate many people in. The beauty of it is that it is a low barrier of entry yet still rigorous and educational. We could also give audience members more ownership by allowing them to submit words for the phrases. We could gameify it by keeping the phrase secret and asking people to guess the phrase by the image.","outcomes":"I'd love to see people participate with Serendipidoodle after Mozfest on Twitter, Instagram, or Tumblr on a daily basis if they can - it's a wonderful brain exercise that is not time consuming. Teachers of course can take this back to the classroom and practice these visual thinking and metaphorical thinking skills with their students of all ages (not to mention the vocabulary students will learn).

Unfortunately, the current reward system in academia often fails to give credit for contributions beyond authorship. Recently, there has been work to move toward a system that both recognises the diversity of roles in a research group as well as reward openness and sharing in the sciences. On the  technical side, the Mozilla Open Badge Infrastructure is a system to recognise expertise or demonstrate accomplishments without traditional means of recognition. In terms of taxonomy, Digital Science, the Wellcome Trust and others have developed a working taxonomy of research contributorship. A prototype is needed to put this in action. With the new Badges Pathways/Discovery, a way to better visualise the usefulness of badges not just in reward but career progression for researchers is now available. With ORCiD , we have another essential building block to integrate into this award mechanism.\n\nThe aim of a badges session would be to begin to craft badges using the above-mentioned taxonomy, to build Research Pathways using these badges, and to work with essential partners (Mozilla Badge Community and Science Lab, ORCiD, Digital Science, Center for Open Science, BMC, and PLoS) to map out an implementable prototype for integrating such badges into the journal article.","agenda":"The session would begin with a presentation on the badges—how they have been used thus far (case studies), their infrastructure, and how one might imagine them being used in research. Then we would split up into 3 working groups: a crafting station, a Pathways station, and a prototyping station. \n\n•\tBadges Crafting. Using the existing contributorship taxonomy, we would begin to craft/design actual badges. If we were using badges to recognise all activities in research science, what would they be? Before MozFest we could set up an Etherpad to get this going and solicit some community feedback via Twitter and blogs.  \n•\tScience hack of Pathways. Let’s create researcher pathways. This would include developing use cases using the taxonomy and applying it to your own career as a researcher. \n•\tCodesprint for the contributorship badges journal workflow. There has already been some discussion between BMC and Mozilla Science Lab as to how this would integrate into the journal article via a “PaperBadger”, a third party site where authors of a paper would complete a matrix on contributorship and iterate until they all had agreed. The authors would then, in agreement as a collaboration, issue their own badges. This would integrate with the publisher site via API. This working group would depend on finding dev resource willing to create and host this third party site. Depending on resources, this group could further discuss the workflow/storyboards just described or it could actually get to work and begin building the site. Hopefully the latter!","scale":"Most of the session is not dependent on a specific number of participants. The presentation at the beginning can be given to as many people as there are. Also, two of the three working groups are fairly autonomous activities (crafting badges, mapping Pathways). The third working group geared toward making a prototype is more fragile. It demands  specific people (people to do dev work, as well as a few key stakeholders). We will be and have begun working with these stakeholders to ensure they are there.","outcomes":"Having working prototypes of the taxonomy in the form of the badges and having mapped out clear career Pathways using the badges can be used to solicit community feedback and to garner more take up of the badges by researchers. Hopefully, by the end of MozFest we will have a few badges able to be used. If things go well, we will have started building the third party site needed to incorporate this into the journal article or at least have started planning this with the key stakeholders.","timestamp":"2014-09-11T12:16:44.004Z"},{"title":"One Click Attributions & Elog.io","theme":"Art and Culture of the Web","themeSlug":"art","facilitators":[{"name":"Jonas Öberg","twitter":"@jonaso"},{"name":"Peter Liljenberg","twitter":"@goodoldshep"}],"organization":"Commons Machinery","goals":"Did you ever want to know who took that awesome photo that you scrolled past in a blog?

We seek to evoke emotion. By the\nend of our conversation, we will have examined and come to the\nconclusion that happiness bears no extravagant and excessive\ndesign. Rather, happiness is born out of the micro interactions\nthat tap into the user's psychological emotion.\n\nBy bringing User Interface Principles to the forefront of our\nconversation, we can shift our mental model to produce beautiful,\nemotionally-captivating digital creations.","agenda":"We will offer as many real world examples as possibles to showcase the theory behind the execution of great User Interface design. After acquainting the participants with successful uses of UI around the web, participants will be asked to design a landing page/app page with the Principles of Gestalt in mind. Participants will only need to wireframe their designs. The goal of this activity is to allow participants to verbalize their design choices. Participants will be asked to showcase their work, along with an explanation, to their partners.","scale":"An even group would be great but not ideal. The session will be structured half lecture, and half activity based.","outcomes":"I see participants leaving the session eager to know more about design. The main goal of this session is to communicate to participants that everyone is a designer. Following simple but meaningful UI Principles will take any design to a more advanced level of execution.","timestamp":"2014-09-11T12:16:44.005Z"},{"title":"Building an Open Repository of Online Tools for Researchers","theme":"Open Science and the Web","themeSlug":"science","facilitators":[{"name":"Kathleen Luschek","twitter":"@kathleenluschek"},{"name":"Thomas Crouzier","twitter":"@ThomasCrouzier"}],"organization":"PLOS Labs","goals":"Participants at the session will:\n\n- Help design a CC-BY licensed online resource for all researchers and scientists to 1) inform about the tools that are available for them to use and  2) help them figure out which ones to use. The challenge comes from creating an organized repository that is not static, but one that encourages participation and collaboration, while still being easy to navigate.\n\n- Learn about new online tools designed for researchers, and about the challenges they face before their potential is fully reached.\n\n- Think about how to facilitate a large scale adoption of these new technologies by researchers. How to best present the benefits and what incentives could help change old habits?","agenda":"First, we will present a selection of the online tools that have recently been developed for researchers (i.e. authoring environments, open lab notebooks, workflow systems, data repositories, etc.). Describe their usefulness and potential impact on Open Science, as well as on the way research is done in general.\n\nSecond, we will show the basic structure of what we have developed (a database of tools available, with in-depth information about each). \n\nThird, we will have the participants brainstorm how to best organize this information and create a community around this platform. For example, how to cite the tool, how to assess tool use, allow commenting/reviews/user profiles. Depending on participant number, we’ll brainstorm about what content can help researchers find and adopt these tools. And how creators and developers could obtain feedback and insights about user needs through this platform.","scale":"This session can work with a large group, or several smaller groups. With five participants, it will be a small brainstorming session based on discussion.  With more people, we’ll split up into groups, and compile all ideas together at the end of the session.\n\nDepending on the number of participants, we’ll use the following themes for each group to focus on, in increasing priority:\n- How to organize the repository database?\n- How to create a community (commenting/user reviews)?\n- What content and functionalities could help promote the adoption of new tools?\n- How to cite tools?\n- How to assess tool use?","outcomes":"Our outcome is to create a tangible benefit to the research community. By receiving input from the participants, we can better create a prototype that provides researchers with a valuable tool and catalyze a stronger digital science community in the process.\n\nParticipants will learn about the existence of these new tools, and their potential impact on science and Open science. Participants who work in research might start using these tools and promote a more connected and open science and inform others of the existence of tools. The session could also inspire developers and spark thoughts about new ways digital science can enhance research.","timestamp":"2014-09-11T12:16:44.005Z"},{"title":"Building resources for Womoz using wiki and blog","theme":"Build and Teach the Web","themeSlug":"teach","facilitators":[{"name":"Netha Hussain","twitter":"@nethahussain"}],"organization":"Womoz, Wikimedia India","goals":"My session involves hacking the Womoz subpage of Mozilla wiki and Womoz blog.

We will think about the construction of narrative - and reflect on differences between linear and non-linearity, and text vs visual storytelling . As both makers and readers of the co-authored narratives, we will consider whether one style is more effective or resonant than another.","agenda":"At the beginning of the session we start people looking through their iphones (or digital cameras) and selecting images that they want to share as part of this collective project (depending on number of participants, image number will range from 10 - 20).\n\nWe upload the selected files and project them so that the entire group observes the range of contributed images.  The images are not identified as authored by a particular person, so the shared 'archive' becomes metaphorically similar to looking through photos at an antique shop.  The images are intriguing visually yet we don't know the back story.\n\nAs a group while studying the images we focus on locating the common themes that emerge in this shared image bank.  In a Lo Fi brainstorming session we create a large 'story concept map' which will become the framework of our co-authored story.  We will identify commonalities, differences, details and map these as story nodes on our paper concept map.  For instance, we may find that many people have similar images documenting shadows, alleyways in cities, trips to forests, gatherings of people, or food pictures.  We will find these 'similar-but-different' moments stored on people's smart phones - moments that have been documented through these ubiquitous image-capturing devices, ie. camera's that are with us at all times.  Often we take hundreds or even thousands of images that may not 'make it' through an edit.  We want to consider these types of images - happenstance, simple documents that may actually get deleted because they aren't necessarily documenting the moment satisfactorily.\n\nAfter we make our contributions to the shared story archive, the images will then be processed by the facilitators - making them all appear like 'black and white ink drawings' - referencing graphic novel drawings.  This technique is a strategy to create the appearance of a cohesive set of images to be used in the telling of the story.\n\nWe then begin to 'storyboard' the shared images, playing with the notion of the 'exquisite corpse' game, we will look at the images for resonant frame to frame transitions, interesting flow and begin to organize them into their story-order.  We individually, of course, only know the 'real story' behind our own images.  This allows us to look at the shared sets with 'fresh eyes', and affords us the freedom to assign new fictional narratives based on the images' connection to other shared images, how they resonate and speak with one another through formal and/or implied connections -  and their potential to add unique elements to the new co-created story.\n\nThe group collectively decides on the final image ordering for the story.\n\nIf the group as a whole has decided to create textual elements as part of the story we will co-author as well.  Text could be used as a kind of connective tissue between series of frames or to create an overarching narrative. This element would be brainstormed in the Lo Fi paper story mapping activity as well.\n\nFor review and construction within the workshop we use simple software application to create a sequential 'slide show' - allowing the participants to see the story results in 'real time' and affords the ability to do live 'frame' editing.","scale":"Ideally we'd make groups of 6 - 20 to get enough variety of images, ideas and voices working on stories.\nIf there were 50 participants we may need to consider making 2 groups and then co-author 2 projects.","outcomes":"Participants will consider concepts around co-authoring and co-creation from both an art process and art 'object' perspective.  \n\nParticipants will receive the co-authored story file art piece.

The challenge comes from creating an organized repository that is not static, but one that encourages participation and collaboration, while still being easy to navigate.\n\n- Learn about new online tools designed for researchers, and about the challenges they face before their potential is fully reached.\n\n- Think about how to facilitate a large scale adoption of these new technologies by researchers. How to best present the benefits and what incentives could help change old habits?","agenda":"First, we will present a selection of the online tools that have recently been developed for researchers (i.e. authoring environments, open lab notebooks, workflow systems, data repositories, etc.). Describe their usefulness and potential impact on Open Science, as well as on the way research is done in general.\n\nSecond, we will show the basic structure of what we have developed (a database of tools available, with in-depth information about each). \n\nThird, we will have the participants brainstorm how to best organize this information and create a community around this platform. For example, how to cite the tool, how to assess tool use, allow commenting/reviews/user profiles. Depending on participant number, we’ll brainstorm about what content can help researchers find and adopt these tools. And how creators and developers could obtain feedback and insights about user needs through this platform.","scale":"This session can work with a large group, or several smaller groups. With five participants, it will be a small brainstorming session based on discussion.  With more people, we’ll split up into groups, and compile all ideas together at the end of the session.\n\nDepending on the number of participants, we’ll use the following themes for each group to focus on, in increasing priority:\n- How to organize the repository database?\n- How to create a community (commenting/user reviews)?\n- What content and functionalities could help promote the adoption of new tools?\n- How to cite tools?\n- How to assess tool use?","outcomes":"Our outcome is to create a tangible benefit to the research community. By receiving input from the participants, we can better create a prototype that provides researchers with a valuable tool and catalyze a stronger digital science community in the process.\n\nParticipants will learn about the existence of these new tools, and their potential impact on science and Open science. Participants who work in research might start using these tools and promote a more connected and open science and inform others of the existence of tools. The session could also inspire developers and spark thoughts about new ways digital science can enhance research.","timestamp":"2014-09-11T12:16:44.007Z"},{"title":"Say It with “SayIt”, a Poplus component: publishing wise words from MozFest 2014","theme":"Open Data","themeSlug":"data","facilitators":[{"name":"Dave Whiteland","twitter":"@mysociety"}],"organization":"mySociety","goals":"We’re going to collect and present quotations, pearls of wisdom, and perhaps even whole session transcripts, using SayIt, which is a tool for publishing transcripts online, beautifully and usefully (for example: http://leveson.sayit.mysociety.org or http://shakespeare.sayit.mysociety.org/hamlet/act-iii/scene-i-a-room-in-the-castle#s529733 ). We’ll look at different ways of getting the data in, which includes direct, interactive input, as well as more automated approaches such parsing and capturing tweets. We’re using things said or reported at MozFest14 for fun, but really we’re showing people how easy it can be to publish transcripts beautifully online. If participants have another source of transcripts, we’d love to use that too. SayIt will introduce participants to the new world of Poplus.org components.","agenda":"We’ll set up a SayIt instance online (that takes moments) and then use different ways of putting data in. This may be through participants’ browsers, or via scraping and parsing -- Poplus developers will be on hand to explain and help code these more interesting approaches. It might be the creation of parsing tools is then used to process transcripts from sessions later in the conference, that is, creating a tool that can be used to capture data.","scale":"With a small number of participants, we’ll work one-on-one with writing custom parsers or scrapers (if they are coders; if not, we’ll play or demo with the existing interface). With many, we’ve got a crowd for crowdsourcing quotes directly into the SayIt in-browser interface… But also, if we have lots of people, between them we can find other sources of documents and transcripts to consume, and then publish with SayIt.","outcomes":"The immediate outcome at the end of the festival is a searchable, linkable, beautiful website of MozFest14 wisdom, yay!

They’ll know what SayIt does and also have a feel for how to scrape or parse source transcripts into the format it can consume (did we mention this is actually Akoma Ntoso,  an open standard?). This is great because the state of online transcripts (particularly in public governance) is currently woeful, and the Poplus project is trying to change that one transcript at a time.

We'll talk about new technology like fingerprinting, policy venues, and what individual Mozillians can do to move the debate forward.","scale":"With five participants, we'll probably take the discussion high level straight away: assume some knowledge of DRM, and go right into how we can explain the current situation to attract a wider audience.\n\nWith 15, we'll go around and ascertain everyone's level of involvement, and hope to break down the problem into several constituencies: open web technologists like Mozilla, advocates like EFF, rightsholders and policymakers. What do they want? How do we sort out a solution that (kind of) works for everyone?\n\nWith 50, we'll break out the index cards. We'll keep the structure as described in the agenda, but leave time for questions, ask everyone to scribble down their ideas, and then see if we can't cluster them all together for some concrete after-meeting initiatives.","outcomes":"Much of the problem with the DRM battle has been that it's been fought in public, with strong words on all sides.

A map can made digital, added to a wiki, and become the foundation for a portal for courses supporting open science, including existing Software Carpentry lessons and other curriculum.","outcomes":"The outcome will form the basis of a course on open research practice suitable for credit-earning at the tertiary level (early stages of graduate school). The workshop will help identify the key elements for which learning outcomes, lesson plans and assessment tools will be needed for such a course. Existing resources will be evaluated for their suitability, and adopted and/or developed further whereas other resources may need to be built from scratch. This will enable us to build course proposals to put forward for adoption by different Institutions.

When you walk closer to a sound, the volume will increase. This is based on the natural way people experience sounds. The sounds can also overlap each other which creates cool possibilities for audio designers.\n\nAt the session I want to create a new app with location-based sounds in London, around the MozFest location, together with participants.","agenda":"We host a session on augmented audio and end it with hacking the MozFest space with audio.\n\nPresentation:\n- Research on location based audio\n- User experience and audio \n- Overview of how the app is created, how we use SoundClouds API, etc.\n- Location based audio\n- Q&A\n\nWorkshop / session:\nWith the participants we can create a new app for Android and iPhone, the location of the audio in the app will be around MozFest, and we can launch this the same day. The participants will create sounds themselves, make field recordings, manipulate sounds from the internet, etc. \n\nThe participants can use audio software they are used to, but it might be great if there is a possibility to connect this session to another session about creating audio, that the participants can use for this app.","scale":"We can do a session for about 12-16 participants.\n\nWe'll divide the participants into groups and give every group an area on the map to work on. In this way they can discuss how they will fill the area and how the sounds can work together. \n\nThe best fit for one group will be 3-4 people. This makes 4 groups when there are 12 participants, and also 4 groups when there are 16 people.","outcomes":"The app we create together is free to download for everyone attending MozFest but also everyone else.

The main activity that'll be in the session is to teach the high school teachers, students who are just starting off programming and others interested in learning the programming concepts taught in universities and high schools. The session will visually and interactive take the attendees through an experience of understanding the concept of building real time applications.Our intention is to provide the AngularJS community with instructions on how to use AngularJS correctly and effectively, but also in its most modern form. The application you are building will go beyond basic use of AngularJS, and we will attempt to explore as much of the framework as possible. We also feel strongly about maintaining modernity in a tutorial, so we will keep it congruent with AngularJS as the framework and community matures.","agenda":"MEAN.JS(MangoDB, Express,Angular.Js and Node.js )will help you getting started and avoid useless grunt work and common pitfalls, while keeping your application organized. Our goal is to create and maintain a simple and readable open-source solution that you can use and trust in your projects.First of all, there are huge advantages to using a uniform language throughout your stack. My team uses a set of tools that we affectionately call the MEAN stack:­ MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS, and Node.js. By coding with Javascript throughout, we are able to realize performance gains in both the software itself and in the productivity of our developers. With MongoDB, we can store our documents in a JSON-­like format, write JSON queries on our ExpressJS and NodeJS based server, and seamlessly pass JSON documents to our AngularJS frontend. Debugging and database administration become a lot easier when the objects stored in your database are essentially identical to the objects your client Javascript sees. Even better, somebody working on the client side can easily understand the server side code and database queries; using the same syntax and objects the whole way through frees you from having to consider multiple sets of language best practices and reduces the barrier to entry for understanding your codebase. This is especially important in a hackathon setting: the team may not have much experience working together, and with such little time to integrate all the pieces of your project, anything that makes the development process easier is gold.Another big reason to go with MongoDB is that you can use it in the same way you would a MySQL database (at least at a high level). My team likes to describe MongoDB as a “gateway drug” for NoSQL databases \u2028because it is so easy to make the transition from SQL to MongoDB.\n\nThe bulk of the session will be spent with individuals or teams developing their components and demo apps, with facilitators serving more of a help desk role. Then the session can end with a round of demos, and a few words on next steps (getting components included as standard if appropriate, publishing and sharing apps, etc.) as appropriate, and feedback from participants on where the process could be smoother.\n\nAs a result this varies with two different levels , Beginners and Intermediate \n\nFor Beginners we, are going to teach them Mean.js completely.We have made beautiful presentations .\nFor those who are familiar  with Mean.js we can go a head by building Real Time applications","scale":"This format should work well with varying numbers of participants.\n\nBeginners ,  If there are 5 we can go deep and spend some time curating, iterating on existing initiatives, or coming up with something new.

It involves a brief introduction to Data Science and Machine Learning and the step involved in tackling a data science problems. A segment involving various different types of interesting data science problems which affect our day to day lives will be discussed. A small demonstration using a sample example will be made which shows, how one can use simple techniques to tackle data science related problems! This is a beginner level session and hence, It doesn't require any previous data science knowledge, but some basic knowledge about Python and basic Mathematics knowledge will really ease the topic to the attendees! Still, no prerequisites are mandatory! The Non-programming community can help identify how data science fits in their area of work and thus propose interesting data science problems which require our attention. Thus, this session is open to all. Both will be benefited with this session!","agenda":"This session shall be 80% theoretical and 20% hands-on. The theory part will discuss the key concepts and points related to the subject matter of Machine Learning and Data Science and the 20% hands-on part will be a practical implementation where, I will discuss about the tools and implementation methodology! One is welcome to bring a laptop to try out the same himself and build one Data Science System. This is not mandatory but highly recommended! I will provide the tools information. In the practical part, I will be using Python as my programming language. It's one of the most easiest languages to understand for a beginner and hence shouldn't be an issue!","scale":"The session is divided as 80% theory and 20% practical (Optional but Recommended). The theoretical part can be introduced to audience numbers ranging from 5 - 100. But it will only be feasible if the practical part is demonstrated by me with a working audience of 15 individuals. This will still require logistic support (internet connection, power adapters etc.) from organizers and may not be all time feasible. As the practical session accounts for 20% of the overall time, hence it shouldn't be a management nightmare! But, if the number of interested participants in practical part is large say 17+, I will prepare a guide which can be distributed among the audience digitally, describing step by step mechanism to build and test a simple data science implementation on their own with all the links to know more about the subject matter.","outcomes":"The focus of this session is to bring more awareness and build enthusiasm towards data science. There are a number of sources now where one can freely download data off the web and using simple machine learning techniques one can build his/her own data analysis system. There is a severe shortage of Data Scientists and each day the data is growing. Data Science if used properly can unlock several secrets and can be used to find solution to a number of problems.

We all know building communities is super hard for both startups and larger organizations! I will cover how one can learn from 'traditional tribes' and work out developing communities around the same concept. I will highlight the elements of building a highly successful community helping one identify leaders other than oneself, who share your common vision and can act as pillars of strength for the community!\nI will also discuss what makes a community prosper and how to grow a community from zero members to a group of super motivated individuals! I will share experiences of my efforts in two different continents, which were poles apart in both language and culture.

I will be preparing slides and some checklists for the attendees which will be available digitally. I have researched this topic and added my personal experiences of being involved in community building in two different continents and working in several different institutions! Hence, I will try to make it an informative yet fun session! There will be an interactive round, where I will open the platform to attendees for discussion so as to gather more ideas and experiences!","scale":"This is an open session, where I will be speaking and discussing various experiences and researched points. In my opinion, if the crowd is large (say 15+) then I will deliver my regular session which will involve a full talk followed by a small Q-A session. Else, if the attendee group size is less than 10, I will revert to a more participatory and collaborative session where after putting up my points, I will leave the platform  open to discussion. I have researched various scenarios involving action points and can have an open discussion for each one if the time persists!","outcomes":"This is a call for action session, where I would like the participants to take lead in their respective regions. Learning from the experiences gained from various sessions at Mozilla Festival, one is left motivated to take the message/knowledge to the remotest places and spread literacy and knowledge about different areas and in turn developing their own communities. In the present age, the problems are getting more and more challenging and to solve them requires the effort of more than one single individual. These problems can range from social to entrepreneurial in nature. What is essential here is the understanding of dynamics of such communities and making them effective so that they last the distance and pass the test of both time and excellence. If my session can help achieve 10% of this goal, I would be highly satisfied with my effort! As, this will create a mini ecosystem of strongly motivated individuals who understand the meaning of working together towards a common goal!

Pub Quiz takes the form of a trivia challenge, but with questions oriented around the internet, covering everything from the serious (dates of major events and tech launches) to the surprising (Javascript conditional evaluation quirks) to the silly (matching memes and emoji shorthanding). This blend of questions will make the game fun and informative for tech nerds as well as anyone who’s curious about how the web works. The team-based format of the game will introduce attendees to each other, sparking conversation and having them learn from each other as well.","agenda":"The questions in Pub Quiz will be balanced between straightforwardly informative topics and more esoteric and surprising topics. Current potential question topics include Tech Esoterica (e.g. JS conditional evaluation quirks, not-so-norm norms), TLDs (whether a given ridiculous TLD is real or not), Internet Organization Acronyms (with points for both the accurate and funniest answers), Important Dates (e.g. putting the series of social network companies in timeline order, naming the first web-based chatroom/meme/gifs), and so on. After asking a question, each team will be given time to discuss and settle on an answer, evening the playing field and letting the contestants share knowledge. Although there will be points and a winner at the end, the game’s irreverent bent will make collaborating with your team and discovering delightful trivia the main focus.","scale":"Pub Quiz is intrinsically scalable: if more people show up, we can always add them to an existing team, or create a new team.

We gonna introduce our participants the latest framework which has wide range of applications in the field of web development. Its is \"Web2py Framework\".\n\nWeb2py Web Framework:\nFree open source full-stack framework for rapid development of fast, scalable, secure and portable database-driven web-based applications.\nIt allows web developers to program dynamic web content using Python.\n\nWhat is Web2py?\nIt is a teaching tool which makes web development easier, faster, and more secure. It  lowers the barrier of entry to web development.\nWeb2py is designed to help reduce tedious web development tasks, such as developing web forms from scratch.\nThe design of Web2py was inspired by the Ruby on Rails (RoR) and Django frameworks.\n          \nEase of use :\nWeb2py is a full-stack framework without dependencies.\nIt requires no installation and no configuration.\nEverything works out of the box, including a web server, database and a web-based IDE that gives access to all the main features. \nIt can interoperate with most web servers, databases and all Python libraries.\n \nRapid development :\nWeb2py automatically generates forms for your data and it allows us to easily expose the data in HTML, XML, JSON, RSS, etc. \nIt provides some high level widgets  to rapidly build complex applications.\n\nSecurity :\nThe Web2py Database Abstraction Layer (DAL) eliminates SQL Injections.\nThe template language prevents Cross Site Scripting vulnerabilities.\nThe forms generated by Web2py provide field validation and block Cross Site Request Forgeries.\nPasswords are always stored hashed. \nSessions are stored server-side by default to prevent Cookie Tampering. \nSession cookies are UUID to prevent Session Hijacking.\n\nRuns with...\nApache, Lighttpd, Cherokee and almost any other web server via CGI, FastCGI,    WSGI, mod_proxy, and mod_python.\n\nTalks to....\nSQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MSSQL, FireBird, Oracle, IBM DB2, Informix, Ingres, and Google App Engine.","agenda":"The best way to understand Web2py is to try it. After demonstration of the framework, We will have a hand-on session for participants on functionality of Web2py.","scale":"With 5 participants we would be guiding them to work individually. So that they can get to know about web2py framework on their own. Also handling 5 participants individually will be easy.\n\nWith 15 participants we would mentor in small groups  \n\nWith 50 participants we would ask them to work as per our guidance.Will make one group leader per domain who can interact with us and help their group efficiently.\n\nIn case we get more participants than anticipated, we will divide people into groups and get them to code together and collaborate. We would probably try to place more experienced, with programming people to each group as informal leaders to guide and help if needed.","outcomes":"It is a session that \"Train the trainers\". Trainers will learn to create, modify, deploy and manage application from anywhere using web browser. They will get used to it so that they can code using Web2py as a base and can interact with other platforms. It fuels the trainers to design and develop things on web .\n\nWeb2py is a tool that can solve the present challenges the web is facing.

The main idea of the session is to introduce people to how they can use their smartphone over a command line. Basically, getting them acquainted with things under the hood which is an important skill when you work with developer devices. The goal is to give people a peek so that they can understand and solve issues when they face trouble flashing the phones or booting devices. Further, the session will also show how you can actually compile C/C++ programs for Firefox OS and run it on the device via a command line without ever using the touch interface. Essentially, the goal is two-fold. One, to get people acquainted with things under the hood. Second, show how useful it actually can be.","agenda":"We will start with an overview of how Firefox OS and Android are structured and discuss briefly about the layers in the OS that we don’t usually see and interact with. Followed by this, we will talk about writing C/C++ code and how it can be useful. After this, we break out into a workshop where people work on small pieces of code and experiment with what the smartphones lower layer.","scale":"The most problematic part would be to get people an access to a smartphone that they can play around with. However, this can be solved as for people who do not have developer phones they can toy around with can be set up with emulators on their laptops which would work just great for the purposes of the session. There will need to be some software that needs to be set up. There will be instructions for people to do this before hand. Of course, there will also be other ways to get this during the session. (via ftp or USB keys) If the number becomes too large, we could split into small groups of, say 5, where people work together.","outcomes":"The main outcome after the festival is people are more willing to take up issues that often come with developer devices. Further, hopefully having an idea of how things work inside will lead to better apps and more support for others who face issues!","timestamp":"2014-09-11T12:16:44.027Z"},{"title":"Responsive Environments","theme":"Art and Culture of the Web","themeSlug":"art","facilitators":[{"name":"Fleeta Chew Siegel","twitter":"@fleetaj"},{"name":"Evan Raskob","twitter":""}],"organization":"Kingston University","goals":"Make an responsive website to allow audience participation during a performance, lecture, or seminar.\nUsers can approach it from the perspective of a performer/speaker or from the audiences perspective.

Although tools like Fix My Street and online services provided by local governments have harnessed the benefits of the web to support cities and communities, they are not perfect. The web browser can be very disconnected from the city streets, particularly for those who don’t own smartphones. \n\nThe aim of this session will be to connect attendees with an interest in civic engagement, communities, physical computing and the Internet of Things to explore the possibilities of the physical web for empowering citizens.  This will enable us to build connections within the community, share progress and ideas, and develop new avenues for future exploration.","agenda":"The session will begin with a round table introduction of attendees, where we will briefly introduce the topic and our reasons for attending the session. Following this, we will split into break out groups, with each group discussing a specific topic. There will be a pre-prepared set of topics, but attendees will also be able to suggest their own during the opening session and will be strongly encouraged to do so. In the breakout groups, participants will identify challenges and opportunities in their topic area and present these back to the group. In the second half of the session, teams will develop and present back a concept for a physical civic engagement tool. These presentations will be recorded for later dissemination.","scale":"The design of session lends itself to flexibility: the number and size of team can be varied according to the number of people attending. Although this will probably work best around 15 people working as 3–5 teams, a very small number of people could work intensively as a single group. In the case of a large number of people, some aspects would need to be altered. For example, introductions might be best done in smaller groups based on particular topics of interest sourced from attendees with volunteers from amongst the participants facilitating.","outcomes":"Videos of presentations will be published online and promoted via the festival hashtag. The outcomes of this session will also inform ongoing research at the University of Dundee, and attendees will have the opportunity to stay involved with this.

CNGs allow a vignette into noise generation: this is digital signal processing which ensures that users ‘keep calm and carry on’. CNG offers (in the artist's opinion) an interesting window into our psychological coupling with distributed systems. By toying with those mechanisms of noise the work moves into proximity with glitch and digital artefacts.\n\nCNGs relate to the ‘just noticeable difference’ concept of psychophysics. The artists intent is that an exhibit which provokes curiosity might prompt reflection upon the software methods through which we are encouraged to feel at home and secure on platforms which exact a heavy toll from our data doppelgangers.","agenda":"This work is proposed for the ‘Art and Culture of the Web’ track. It will have an accompanying related workshop, entitled ‘Of Social Physics and Psychophysics’ which will elaborate on the broader thematics in a participatory fashion (this has been proposed in a separate submission). \nOn site execution will transpire through active noise cancelling headphones, or within a relatively sound protected area.","scale":"The number of visitors that can experience the artwork is dependant on the number of headphone sets that can be procured (should a headphone execution be implemented). There will be additional documentary material, presented in a comparable format to the deliberately staid exposition that characterised YoHa’s Evil Media Exhibition at Transmediale 2013.","outcomes":"This artwork comments on a number of aspects of digital culture: personal information management, filter bubbles, automation, military R&D into persona management and sentiment analysis.\nI consider this work will act as an extension of Stephen Fortune’s earlier contribution to the Torque Symposium (elaborating upon ‘Echoes of Individuation: The Black Stack, Bicameral Minds & Electronic Voice Phenomena’), which took inspiration from Benjamin Bratton’s concept of ‘composite users’ and\nexplored ‘hearing voices’ as a potent phenomenological instance of the social mind in contrast to presumed postdigital neurotypicality.\nPotential concrete outcomes are sound files that can then be shared with the ASMR (autonomous sensory meridian response) community on reddit and hopefully feedback on their efficacy can be gleaned from those on the internet who derive pleasure, rather than mere comfort, from acoustic and visual noise.","timestamp":"2014-09-11T12:16:44.027Z"},{"title":"Of Social Physics and Psychophysics","theme":"Art and Culture of the Web","themeSlug":"art","facilitators":[{"name":"Stephen Fortune","twitter":"@quadrophobiac"}],"organization":"","goals":"This workshop explores attention and agential action in digital society by playing with markov chains applied to a corpus of the participants words (this corpus is pulled from Facebook).\nSocial physics considers that the soft interactions and tacit agreements that bind a collection of individuals into a society can be computationally modelled (and presumably simulated & optimised) via big data (often ‘user generated’ data).\nPsychophysics gave us the JPEG and mp3, it’s a discipline interested in how information can be compressed without human perception noticing a discernible difference between low and high fidelity media. The idea of Just Noticeable Difference (JND) is key.\nThe workshop asks what happens when the two combine? If psychophysics has worked out the threshold below which lossy media passes as aesthetically acceptable, might social physics deduce the level at which a markov chain might slip unnoticed amid the crowd of social media chatter?\nIt applies the JND to illuminate militarised automated interventions into the social forums which are digital and social media.","agenda":"This will be a participatory workshop format - participants are doing and making, and that activity is supplemented with discussion about related developments and backdrop. These include topics such as persona management, CAPTology, the attention economy and automation. The aspiration is for the workshop leader to learn as much from the participants as they do from partaking.\nAccessing ones user data will be accomplished via Facebook Javascript SDK. For all intents & purposes the process will be plug and play, and the markov model will be a black box. This is deliberate to get participants thinking about opaque processes that transduce data into a certain recognisable output and also prompt discussion about what one cannot do with their Facebook API access. For instance they can learn all about their utterances, but can gain no insight into how their friends utterances (which appear in their feed) might be conceivably simulated.","scale":"I believe this workshop will require a maximum participant level declared in advance. \nIf the desire is for the workshop to scale based on number of interested attendees then I propose the following.\nIf the number of participants exceeds 8 the artist would require volunteer assistance, particularly those with competency in basic web technologies to assist with troubleshooting.","outcomes":"I think this workshop, in tandem with its partner artwork “UT?” (submitted in a separate proposal), can initiate a conversation around the depth of programming (and statistical) knowledge requisite to informed and agential engagement with distributed systems and the digital media built atop those systems.

A resource of ‘demographic’ pseudo users (as recently compiled in Axicom’s Consumer Data Products Catalog) provides a skeleton (or scaffold) upon which users will be encouraged to hang a narrative, sketches, or infographic caricatures.\n\nDigital Doppelgangers, data personas, aggregate profiles, risk factors and many other terms designate the abstractions produced from population scale data (note this term is far preferable to ‘big data’ as terminology) analysis. These abstractions provide purchase on our behaviours, tendencies, vulnerabilities and motives for those who have undertaken the data modelling.\n\nThis participatory workshop invites users to consider how they compare to data shadows (in a manner redolent of Kevin Carter’s ‘Landscape Portrait’). Moreover it invites them to put a face to these abstractions, and bear witness to one of the shadows they cast.","agenda":"Several paths have been devised, in the spirit of a participatory transmedia experience. Each path contributes to a live website that will grow over the festival.\n\n_Crowdsourced Tagging_\nIn total there are 80 unique Axicom profiles. Each will have a web page, editable by anyone in Wikipedia fashion. Users will be encouraged to tag what they think these abstractions would watch, drink or visit. These metadata tags provide content & context for part 3.\n\n_Portraits of a Data Personae_\nUsing ‘user story’ wireframes common in UX and UI design, participants will be invited to sketch (by hand) pictures of the cast of characters that occupies Axicoms current compendium.\n\n_Lightbeam Derive_\nTags from party 1 are added to an automate Firefox script. The script goes surfing about the internet. The firefox browser is running Lightbeam. The cookie and tracking cloud this derive accumulates on lightbeam becomes a data portrait for the Axicom personae.","scale":"This workshop can scale, curtailed only by the paper and laptops available to those who wish to participate. \nThis is also a workshop that can be restaged, and potentially hosted by multiple Mozillian volunteers, as the technology involved is all easy to grasp.","outcomes":"The site and artwork will only exist as a live entity for the duration of Mozfest.\nThe author is a PhD candidate at Sussex, exploring the relationship between data subjectivity and big data including tracking data as as pursued by quantified self communities. This workshop will be invaluable in appreciating how to broach these topics through practice lead research. I also hope it will contribute to the growing body of research that considers how we might understand our subjectivity via infographics. Part of my research is concerned with how individuals in data society can relate back to metrics that result from population (or N > 3000) scale data aggregation and subsequent statistical analysis.","timestamp":"2014-09-11T12:16:44.027Z"},{"title":"What comes after open access?","theme":"Open Science and the Web","themeSlug":"science","facilitators":[{"name":"Mitar Milutinovic","twitter":"@mitar_m"},{"name":"Xuan An Ho","twitter":""},{"name":"Rodrigo Ochigame","twitter":""}],"organization":"UC Berkeley","goals":"The idea is to start a discussion about what comes after open access.

The facilitator himself will be at the festival with his 1½ old son. Feeding, burping, sleeping & playing are all acceptable activities at this session.","agenda":"We'll meet. We'll talk. We'll cry.

What would you like from an API to TV news clips?  We have a basic API -- how can we together improve and extend it?  What kind of experiments or research over text and video would help others?\n\nWe have an example we could together mock up.  Given a video clip somewhere on the web, find where in our news archive that clip was broadcast.  An idea -- use \"Sphinx\" audio-to-text package and \"Simhash\" to compare the external clip with our archive, and present the best matches.\n\nHow else could we do or try this together?  Are there better or faster matching ideas?\nThis is just one example of researching a large archive -- let's come up with more!","agenda":"We start with a quick 5-10 minute lightning demo (to help participants grok our Archive), show the site, and the API.\n\nThen, we brainstorm together fun ideas, pie-in-the-sky ideas, and others on what kinds of experiments our participants think or drive of.\nNext, figure out what new/better API pieces we'd need to make these ideas.\n\nThe second part would be a hack-and-design-athon for doing something fun like finding clips using only video as input.  Kristen, a designer, can work more with those interested in design/UI/UX and research access.  Tracey can work more with those more coder-oriented.

People usually know about a  place from personal experience which they store in the form of anecdotes  and sentiments. How can this stuff be turned into hard data? In this session, we'll use the example of a 13 hectar piece of land slotted for development, but trapped in regulations and bad ideas, and a citizen initiative dreaming of a green oasis. The citizen initiative has already documented all the trees on the land, and they want to collect other ecological information from the area using mobile devices. They want their peers to be able to submit ideas for the space to their local government, and help people take control over their own neighborhood design.\nWhat would a mobile app look like that allows citizens to collect data about a specific place? What does it take to develop OpenStreetMap into a tool for citizen city planners?","agenda":"Mozfesters will work together to create categories and strategies  for collecting data  systematically, and begin to think about how the data might be visualized – using the case study as a real world example. We will try to sketch a prototype. This session will focus on ideation and research to figure out what such a web/mobile app might look like and what kind of ecological and political data sets exist or need to be created to empower citizens to design their neighborhoods.

After three successful six week cohort programs, for 2014 we are distributing both the teaching materials, class program and organizational model for free on Github as ‘Skillab Open Source’. At our session, attendees will be introduced to the materials, learning manifesto and flipped-classroom structure and learn how to download, customize and convert our Github hosted Markdown.md into other printable and shareable formats. With the help of previous Skillab mentors attendees will pair up and workshop the first part of the first class Thinking Programmatically and get some hands on coaching and practice being conversational in code for beginners. The target attendee is either a programing professional – potential mentors, or adult educator – potential class facilitator. New potential students welcome too.","agenda":"We will start the session with a brief introduction and downloading of materials, so that participants will be confortable accessing and contributing to Skillab’s Open Source project later. We will then workshop the introductory class “Thinking Programmatically” where students, mentors and facilitators explore algorithm, instruction and code from the perspective of being the computer program. Working in small groups with a professional programmer mentor available to each group, teams must try to order cards in the correct sequence to describe programs, describe patterns and pictures for other teams to draw without viewing them and a 20 questions role-play game similar to the Turing Test. Mentors and ex students if available in each group will allow attendees to experience what it means to teach about thinking programmatically and how this helps novice computer users gain confidence in their studies and when conversing about code.","scale":"Skillab classes generally balance two students to each mentor - the idea being that students can study at home but need to discuss what they do and gain encouragement to do more when tackling real problems with professionals. The teamwork based nature of this first workshop allows us to double that and accommodate up to 20. But attendees at MozFest are likely to be as much potential mentor as student, so the workshop then grows to accommodate around 60 - our mentors would each guide three attendees as mentors, and they in turn guide groups of three students. Flexibility on the day comes from adjusting to the roles (student or mentor) by the attendees but a maximum of not much more than 60 should be imagined.","outcomes":"The Skillab Open Source Project can be freely used by anyone interested in setting up a Skillab, from students and volunteer mentors to facilitators, wherever they can find a space to do so. We would hope that attendees take our encouragement and fun demonstration of becoming a teacher and establish a Skillab where they live. The materials they will use in the session, and the tools they are exposed to, are available for free at our site and at Github. The project also welcomes new contributions, through software standard fork and pull-requests, and feedback on the accessibility and suitability of Github for a project like this. We hope to be launching a community organization tool soon on our website to match mentors and students and to help in finding free spaces to run Skillabs. Hopefully, festival participants will want to use that too.","timestamp":"2014-09-11T12:16:44.036Z"},{"title":"Discover how to cut your heating bill by 30-50% using Internet of Things (IoT)","theme":"Open Web With Things","themeSlug":"physical","facilitators":[{"name":"Mark Hill","twitter":"@opentrv"},{"name":"Damon Hard-Davis","twitter":""},{"name":"Michael Castle","twitter":""}],"organization":"OpenTRV","goals":"This session focuses on how to analyse temperature profiles of each room within a building to understand how existing heating systems are inefficient.

So its quite hard for a Customer support executive to provide support to them and make them understand. In the session, they will learn how to provide them better support by visualization and make the essential material to provide support to illiterate people.","agenda":"First, we will have prepared list of the common problems facing by users and also keep prepared the solve of that type of problem from Mozilla Support Knowledge Base Articles. After that, we will make visual screenshots of the step by step instructions by pointing what the users need to do. Then, we will arrange all the screenshots to solve a problem. After that make a app using \"App maker\" by showing the sequence of screenshots. add more audio context by app maker. After making a app with the solving way of a certain problem, its possible to send that App to users by MMS or other way. So the users will open the app and can get visual instruction to solve his problem.","scale":"If there is little number of people interested, We will teach them the whole thing and say them to make screenshots of the solve of problem individually and how to make the App with App Maker. Then will give them individually task to make all the things from screenshot to make app with that screenshots.\nIf the number is medium as 15 people, we will divide them between 3 groups. One groups will say their problem and another 2 groups will do the whole process from making screenshot to making app and send the first group. And the first group will judge which one is better. So there will be more brainstorming between 2 groups and will get more ways to improve the ways.\nIf there is large number of people about 50 people, it will be more awesome because that time we will separate them between 7 groups. 2 Groups for making Screenshot, 2 Groups for making app without audio, 2 groups for making app with Audio and 1 group for throwing problems. So the group will throw problems and the 2 groups will make screenshots separately by pointing out the solve more visual. then they wll send their screenshots to all the 4 App making team to make the app with Audio and without Audio. Both 4 teams will make App separately and send to first team. Then first we will show the 2 apps without Audio to the team and ask them which is helpful and if they can solve the problem without audio. Then we will show the 2 apps with Audio to them and ask which one is better and if with Audio is necessary or not. In this way, they will brainstorm to provide more better support and find out the way. And we will get that which method is more helpful.","outcomes":"The outcomes of the Session is very huge. The people will get Idea how to provide support to any person who can not read Documentation instructions also how to deal with them. If there is people working in User support, they can implement it in his/her work place to deal with the support asking people. Also they will also learn how easy to make any App. Moreover, everyone will learn how to help someone in the way he wants and which is useful to him. they will get how to help a people when he/she can not understand any instructions.

Aside from providing a fun learning activity, my purpose in holding this workshop is to gain feedback from the participants as to what works well and what should be altered and what are best practices for teaching such tools, particularly in how youth who participate in this workshop in the future end up reaching the learning goals.  This mini-workshop is part of a longer 2-day workshop.  Eyebeam is in the position of reassessing the workshop and its components as it prepares for programming in the fall and spring.  In the fall, Eyebeam intends to workshop the various components as module sessions, facilitating workshops in varying lengths of time and holding them at locations outside of our own space, including schools and libraries with direct reach to youth.","agenda":"The longer part of the workshop (30 min) is the creation of the gloves. Using a guide and template, participants will create conductive pads for the gloves by cutting out pieces of foam paper, conductive fabric, and adhesive paper for each glove in the pair and attaching them to the gloves.  Once the construction of gloves are complete, they can connect the glove’s pad with alligator clips to the Flora, an Arduino-based microcontroller used in wearables and developed by Adafruit.  Then they will connect the Flora to the computer using a USB cable.  With code we provide that programs the Flora to work as a space bar on a keyboard, students can use the gloves to play the one-key digital games. The digital game--a clapping game--used in this session was developed for the Playable Fashion weekend workshops in Unity3D.  The shortest part of the workshop (5 min) is playing the game with the gloves.  A 10-minute portion of the workshop will be to change a few elements of the code to hack the game.  I will provide a worksheet for participants to provide feedback on each section they participated in.","scale":"Based on the HOMAGO (Hanging Out Messing Around Geeking Out) framework, the workshop fits into different lengths of the workshop participants can be involved in, as\nmentioned above.

I plan to keep things simple with a few \"sandboxes\", limiting complexity to a few setup commands, and then editing a stylesheet. This way participants can try out techniques with a measure of creative freedom, but within helpful limits – this will keep them focused on learning, without getting bogged down in the \"project-picking\" problem of some workshops.","scale":"The only things that are likely to vary by audience size will be the amount of fielded questions during the presentation portion, and the amount of ad-hoc support during the workshop portion. If people are having trouble with the setup, or don't have a laptop, I'll invite people with laptops and more experience to volunteer as a group leader, and others can follow along with them.\n\nIn a larger crowd I'm more likely to ask that people hold conceptual questions for the end, and also to ask more experienced participants to function as troubleshooters, to help out anyone else having technical problems. A smaller group will be simpler to manage in this way.","outcomes":"My goal is to support the open data and open mapping communities. There are more ways to make data visualizations and maps than ever, but there are a few technical and conceptual hurdles to get over before you can really see how they can apply to you.
